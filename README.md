# Skedda Technical Challenge â€“ Task 2: Fisher-Yates

I decided to go with **Task 2: Fisher-Yates**.

This solution includes:
- Controller with a GET endpoint /fisheryates 
- A service interface and implementation that currently just throws a NotImplementedException as per instructions.
- Added dependency injection in Program.cs  
- Wrote 5 unit tests to cover expected behavior, edge cases, and randomness

Let me know if anything else is needed.
